<!-- YOU CAN EDIT ANYTHING BELOW HERE -->

<p>Let me introduce myself, I&#39;m Kristan Armstrong and I&#39;m the daughter of an outrageously adventurous woman who has been an avid traveler her whole life.  Some people just have the travel bug
and others learn it from others, but once you get it it&#39;s hard to get rid of.  That&#39;s what happened to my mother, and now subsequently my sister and myself also suffer from the same
disease. It&#39;s hard to stay in one place your whole life when there is so much more to discover.  Discovery is dangerous.  It can be an addiction that runs through your veins so potent that
you end up doing things you never dreamed you would do. For me, discovery has been a catalyst to wanting to know more, experiencing new things and asking more questions about life, politics
and science.  Discovery is what lead me to graduate with a double degree in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics, I wanted to know more about life and what I was capable of achieving.</p>

<p>You see, before going to college I wasn&#39;t even sure I was going to graduate high school.  In fact, my GPA was so low coming out of high school that I had to attend a community college for a
year before applying to CU - Boulder.  This wasn&#39;t because I had hard time learning, I just simply didn&#39;t apply myself nor did I want to.  I was a competitive figure skater, I was more focused
on what I could push my body to do than what I could push my brain to do.  I never had physics or chemistry in high school, so of course I never dreamed that I would get a degree in Physics or
any other subject remotely related to it.  My inquisitive nature and the urge for discovery lead me down that path, as well as, many other avenues which I will share with you soon...</p>

<!--![Cancun, Mexico](/pictures/DSC08351.JPG)-->  

<p>Now I know that was a little long winded and you&#39;re probably wondering when I am going to introduce my family.  Well first off, here we all are:</p>

<!-- DO NOT TOUCH -->

<div><center>
<img class="class /pictures/best/DSC08351.JPG 'Cancun, Mexico'" src="'/pictures/best/DSC08351.JPG'">
</center></div>

<p><center> Brooke (left), Joyce (center),  Kristan (right)</center>
<center> Cancun, Mexico </center></p>

<!-- ADD IN MORE TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->

<p>Let&#39;s start from the left and let me introduce my free-spirited sister, Brooke, she is a vivacious entrepreneur who is always looking for the next great business idea.  She is as unpredictable
as myself, at least in terms of life goals and careers.  My mother had a handful with this little terror when she was a child, while I was hyperactive, my sister was on a mission for independence.
But seriously, could my Mom even be surprised?  Look at who raised us!  She is the one who gave us the appetite for adventure and taught us about the importance of independence from the time we
were little girls.  Of course, my sister may have taken these life lessons a little too over the top, haha, like every teenager does.  She was using the idea of independence to paint the most
creative portrait of her life.  That&#39;s what artists do they express themselves through seeing the world from a different perspective.  After graduating with a degree in Graphic Design she ended
up opening her own Native American jewelery and crafts business in Morrison, CO.  This business was just the beginning, after trying the jewelery business she decided that it wasn&#39;t quite for
her and she decided to go into the marijuana business.  </p>

<p>Now for the main culprit of all our restlessness, our loving and very supportive mother, Joyce.  She is definitely a product of the 70s although she kept all the good parts and threw out the rest.
What I mean by this is that she hasn&#39;t forgotten what it&#39;s like to be young, wild and free but she also hasn&#39;t forgotten that life is comprised of many responsibilities.  When she was younger she
also drove her parents crazy, mainly because of her rebellious nature.  This rebellious nature was the synergist to her passion for traveling.  In her 20s she traveled most of the U.S. including
Alaska, she saw all of it by driving and in some cases only two lane dirt roads for miles.  However, as life would have it she ended up meeting a man, getting married and having my sister which
meant that her passion for traveling had to be put aside.  After her first marriage, she ended up meeting my father and opened up a chain of restaurants and bars which were highly successful.
So long story short, the real brunt of our travel (outside the U.S.) didn&#39;t start until many years later when I was in college and we were all finally able to get away to start exploring the
rest of world!</p>
